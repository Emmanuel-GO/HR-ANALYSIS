## Introduction  
Within the highly competitive world of technology consulting, where skill and creativity are essential for success, Synergy Enterprise is distinguished as a leader dedicated to establishing new benchmarks for the sector. Understanding the importance of human capital management (HCM) for maintaining competitiveness and growth (Hollenbeck et al., 2019), the Australian-based Synergy Enterprise firm exemplifies resilience and adaptation in the face of quick technology improvements.  
Synergy Enterprise recognizes that in order to properly optimize our HCM initiatives, strategic insights are necessary in the constant quest of excellence. Consequently, the purpose of this analysis is to use Power BI to examine our workforce dynamics and address important issues in the technology consulting industry, including attrition, wage trends, job satisfaction, and demographics. Through rigorous analysis and evidence-based recommendations, we seek to fortify our strategies, cultivate a thriving workplace environment, and ensure continued success in this dynamic industry landscape. 

## Statement of the problem 
Human capital management (HCM) presents difficulties for Synergy Enterprise, mainly in relation to employee attrition, wage trends, job satisfaction, and demographics.  
Customer satisfaction and organizational continuity are negatively impacted by attrition rates within particular departments and populations. Salary disparities between occupations and educational levels generate concerns about fair compensation policies and worker happiness. Changes in the degree of job satisfaction indicate possible dissatisfaction, which impacts worker productivity and organizational effectiveness. Further research is necessary since demographic variables including age, gender, and marital status may have an impact on work satisfaction and attrition rates.  
In order to ensure Synergy Enterpriseâ€™ continued success and growth in the technology consulting industry, addressing these issues necessitates a complete HCM strategy study to detect trends and actions.  

## Data Source & Findings
Synergy Enterprise first transferred the data findings from Data-world into Excel format before cleaning and analyzing them. Important information about attrition patterns, salary trends, job satisfaction, performance ratings of active employees, retention, and job satisfaction surfaced. These insights helped shape strategies for maximizing human capital management and promoting organizational success. 

## Data Transformation
A number of adjustments were made to improve the analysis's capabilities. First, in order to guarantee proper computations and visualizations, some columns needed to have their data types changed. We transformed numerical data about performance ratings, work satisfaction levels, and environmental satisfaction into categorical data and categorized them into low, medium, high, and very high groups. To make comparison and trend identification easier, these categories were also given ranks according to their 
significance or influence. These changes made it possible to analyze attrition, job satisfaction, retention, and compensation trends more deeply, which aided in the development of successful strategies for human resource management and organizational performance. 

## Data Information
The offered dataset includes a wide range of employee-related data that is necessary for in-depth examination and organizational decision-making. Data on a number of topics are covered, including work-life balance evaluations, employee demographics, job roles, pay information, and tenure-related variables. When taken as a whole, these data points offer insightful information about organizational dynamics, job-related characteristics, compensation patterns, and employee demographics. By analyzing this dataset, strategic planning and wellinformed decision-making may be addressed with regard to employee satisfaction, retention, and overall organizational performance.
