## Introduction  
Within the highly competitive world of technology consulting, where skill and creativity are essential for success, Synergy Enterprise is distinguished as a leader dedicated to establishing new benchmarks for the sector. Understanding the importance of human capital management (HCM) for maintaining competitiveness and growth (Hollenbeck et al., 2019), the Australian-based Synergy Enterprise firm exemplifies resilience and adaptation in the face of quick technology improvements.  
Synergy Enterprise recognizes that in order to properly optimize our HCM initiatives, strategic insights are necessary in the constant quest of excellence. Consequently, the purpose of this analysis is to use Power BI to examine our workforce dynamics and address important issues in the technology consulting industry, including attrition, wage trends, job satisfaction, and demographics. Through rigorous analysis and evidence-based recommendations, we seek to fortify our strategies, cultivate a thriving workplace environment, and ensure continued success in this dynamic industry landscape. 

## Statement of the problem 
Human capital management (HCM) presents difficulties for Synergy Enterprise, mainly in relation to employee attrition, wage trends, job satisfaction, and demographics.  
Customer satisfaction and organizational continuity are negatively impacted by attrition rates within particular departments and populations. Salary disparities between occupations and educational levels generate concerns about fair compensation policies and worker happiness. Changes in the degree of job satisfaction indicate possible dissatisfaction, which impacts worker productivity and organizational effectiveness. Further research is necessary since demographic variables including age, gender, and marital status may have an impact on work satisfaction and attrition rates.  
In order to ensure Synergy Enterprise’ continued success and growth in the technology consulting industry, addressing these issues necessitates a complete HCM strategy study to detect trends and actions.

## Data Source & Findings
Synergy Enterprise first transferred the data findings from Data-world into Excel format before cleaning and analyzing them. Important information about attrition patterns, salary trends, job satisfaction, performance ratings of active employees, retention, and job satisfaction surfaced. These insights helped shape strategies for maximizing human capital management and promoting organizational success. 

## Data Transformation
A number of adjustments were made to improve the analysis's capabilities. First, in order to guarantee proper computations and visualizations, some columns needed to have their data types changed. We transformed numerical data about performance ratings, work satisfaction levels, and environmental satisfaction into categorical data and categorized them into low, medium, high, and very high groups. To make comparison and trend identification easier, these categories were also given ranks according to their 
significance or influence. These changes made it possible to analyze attrition, job satisfaction, retention, and compensation trends more deeply, which aided in the development of successful strategies for human resource management and organizational performance. 

## Data Information
The offered dataset includes a wide range of employee-related data that is necessary for in-depth examination and organizational decision-making. Data on a number of topics are covered, including work-life balance evaluations, employee demographics, job roles, pay information, and tenure-related variables. When taken as a whole, these data points offer insightful information about organizational dynamics, job-related characteristics, compensation patterns, and employee demographics. By analyzing this dataset, strategic planning and wellinformed decision-making may be addressed with regard to employee satisfaction, retention, and overall organizational performance.

## By Age
 Attrition rates by age group provide important insights into labor dynamics. Visualization of the data using a clustered bar chart facilitates easy comparisons between age groups. Workers under 25 had the highest attrition rate (39.18%), which could be attributed to things like career exploration. The rate is lower for individuals between the ages of 25 and 34 (20.22%), which probably reflects more established professional routes. Similar attrition rates of 10% are seen among workers in the 35–44 and 45– 55 age groups, indicating stability and contentment. Employees over 55 had the lowest attrition rate (15.94%), maybe as a result of retirement planning. The clustered bar chart effectively illustrates these trends, aiding stakeholders in identifying areas of concern and strength and supporting data-driven decision-making for targeted talent retention strategies. 

## By Department
  This provides important insights into workforce dynamics. Attrition rates are efficiently communicated in a visually striking way when visualized using a gauge chart. At 38.55%, the sales department has the greatest turnover rate, maybe as a result of the rigorous nature of sales roles. In contrast, the HR department's slightly lower attrition rate of 35.59% may be a reflection of the company's culture and prospects for career advancement. With a rate of 25.86%, the Research and Development (R&D) department has the lowest attrition rate. This is probably because of things like innovation and a positive work atmosphere. Thus, the gauge chart highlights attrition challenges in each department, facilitating data-driven decision-making and targeted interventions to enhance employee retention and organizational performance. 

## By Environmental Satisfaction Level

 This Provides an important insights into staff retention elements that come from the 
analysis of attrition rates based on environmental satisfaction levels.  
The high attrition rate of 25.35% among workers with poor environmental satisfaction ratings suggests that there may be job unhappiness.  
An average degree of happiness with the work environment is shown by the reduced attrition rate 
of 14.98% among those with medium environmental satisfaction levels.  
The attrition rate of 13.45% is marginally lower among workers who report very high levels of environmental satisfaction, suggesting room for improvement in the workplace.  
Stakeholders can evaluate the overall effect of workplace perceptions on employee retention by using a column chart, which depicts these attrition trends.

Through the integration of evidence-based tactics and actionable insights obtained from the dashboard, Synergy Enterprise can steer towards organizational excellence and cultivate a workforce that is more resilient, engaged, and produces high-quality work. 
1.	Improve Management of Performance: Based on the results of the study about performance ratings across various job types and age groups, Synergy Enterprise should implement focused activities to improve performance. To increase productivity and effectiveness, especially in roles with lower performance indicators, customized training modules, mentorship programs, and performance-linked incentives should be used (F.Hollenbeck et al., 2019; Liang & Chu, 2020).

2.	Optimize Talent Management Strategies: Recalibrating talent management practices is urgently needed because of the differences in compensation distribution across various educational credentials, as demonstrated by the average monthly income by education field and degree level analysis. It is critical to guarantee fair possibilities for pay increases and career advancements based on qualifications and merit (Brown & Green, 2018; Smith et al., 2017).
   
3.	Promote Inclusion and Diversity in the Workforce: The information obtained from marital status and gender-specific performance assessments highlight how important diversity and inclusion (D&I) programs are. Synergy Enterprise should prioritize diversity and inclusion (D&I) initiatives, which include inclusive leadership practices, minority recruiting drives, and bias training (Jackson & Smith, 2021; Jones & White, 2020). This will help to create a more inclusive workplace culture.
	
4.	Improve Work-Life Balance Support: There is definitely room for improvement in work-life balance, even if a significant portion of employees report high levels of satisfaction—particularly among those who report moderate levels of satisfaction. Synergy Enterprise should increase work-life balance initiatives including wellness programs and flexible work hours in order to improve employee retention and well-being (F. Hollenbeck et al., 2019; Liang & Chu, 2020).
